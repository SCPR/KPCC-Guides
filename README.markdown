## KPCC Guides

Blurbs, guides, ideas and thoughts stemming from the web development process at KPCC.

This repository is meant to be a way to organize posts so they can later be grabbed 
and parsed by Tumblr or whatever. Or you can just read them here. :)

Why? Because I like writing posts in markdown and tumblr doesn't. That's about it.
